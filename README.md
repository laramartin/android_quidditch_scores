# Score System
There are three type of balls: Quaffle ball, Bludgers and the Snitch.

- Team that throws a **Quaffle ball** and goes through the hoop, scores **10 points**.

- Once the Snitch is catched, the team with more points wins. If there's a tie the game continues until a team scores points.
