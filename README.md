# Score System
There are three type of balls: Quaffle ball, Bludgers and the Snitch. 
- Bludgers try to knock players off their brooms, but doesn't affect to score. 
- Team that throws a **Quaffle ball** and goes through the hoop, scores **10 points**. 
- Catching the **Snitch** adds **150 points** and ends the game. 
- Once the Snitch is catched, the team with more points wins. If there's a tie the game continues until a team scores points.
